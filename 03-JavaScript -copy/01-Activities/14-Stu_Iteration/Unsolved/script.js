// As a member of the class, I want to store a list of my classmates and use that list to create a greeting for each student on the list.

// It's done when the names of five classmates are stored in a single variable named students.

// It's done when the total number of elements in the students array is logged to the console.

// If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

// What‚Äôs a while loop?

var students=['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd', 'eee']
console.log(students.length);

for(var i=0; i<=students.length-1; i++){
    console.log('Great to see you,', students[i]+'!' );
}

for(var i=students.length-1; i>=0; i--){
    console.log('Great to see you,', students[i]+'!' );

}

var i=(students.length-1);
while(i>=0){
    console.log('Great to see you,', students[i]+'!' )
    i--;
