// It's done when I have created a music object in Unsolved/index.js.

// It's done when I have added title, artist, and album properties to the music object.

// It's done when I have used template literals inside the songSnippet variable to output data from the music object.

// It's done when I see the results in my command line after I run the index.js file.

// ðŸ’¡ Hints
// Can we use template literals in place of string concatenation?
